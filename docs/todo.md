# Floorper Refactoring Plan

## Analysis Phase
- [x] Initialize Git repository
- [x] Clone and analyze Floorper code
- [x] Create detailed refactoring plan

## Refactoring Phase
- [x] Unify browsermigrator and floorpizer into floorper
- [x] Implement core modules (constants, browser detector, backup manager, profile migrator)
- [x] Remove duplicate code
- [x] Standardize naming conventions
- [x] Improve error handling
- [x] Enhance browser detection capabilities
- [x] Add support for exotic and retro browsers
- [x] Implement backup restoration functionality

## Interface Development
- [x] Develop modern TUI using Textual
- [x] Enhance PyQt6 GUI
- [x] Implement comprehensive CLI
- [ ] Make sure floorper shows GUI with not option/flag passed

## Testing and Optimization
- [ ] Massive and very strict and very deep compatibility testing with all possible supported browsers (installing them first, including Floorp too) with all possible corner cases
- [x] Optimize performance with caching and parallel processing
- [ ] Use exclusively the best TUI implementation, remove the others and keep improving it.
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Ensure CLI functionality
- [ ] Ensure TUI functionality
- [ ] Ensure GUI functionality
- [ ] Implement consistent UX across all interfaces
- [ ] Improve *ALL* browser support to be totally implemented
- [ ] Code cleaning and make it easier to read it for humans

## Testing Phase
- [ ] Test ALL browser compatibility
- [ ] Improve browser compatibility based in the results of the tests
- [ ] Test cross-platform functionality
- [ ] Test backup and restoration features
- [ ] Test migration functionality

## Optimization Phase
- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Reduce memory usage
- [ ] Improve startup time
- [ ] Enhance migration speed
- [ ] Show progress bars and all kind of feedback about what the app is doing
## Documentation Phase
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Update user guide
- [ ] Update developer documentation
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams
- [ ] Document browser compatibility

## Finalization Phase
- [ ] Final code review
- [ ] Final testing
- [ ] Create very extensive reports of ALL changes to push it later to the repository
- [ ] Push changes to repository
