# Floorper Comprehensive Refactoring Plan

## Phase 1: Code Quality & Architecture Improvements

### Core Architecture Refactoring
- [ ] Implement proper separation of concerns (model-view-controller pattern)
- [ ] Reduce coupling between components
- [ ] Create clear interfaces between modules
- [ ] Implement proper dependency injection
- [ ] Replace any global state with context objects

### Code Cleanup
- [ ] Remove duplicate code and implement DRY principles
- [ ] Standardize naming conventions across codebase
- [ ] Add comprehensive type hints
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling strategy
- [ ] Refactor long methods (>20 lines) into smaller functions
- [ ] Remove commented-out code and unused imports

### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement proper unit test framework
- [ ] Create mock objects for testing
- [ ] Set up continuous integration
- [ ] Implement code coverage reporting
- [ ] Add integration tests for browser detection and migration

## Phase 2: Performance Optimization

### Memory Usage
- [ ] Profile memory usage during large migrations
- [ ] Implement incremental data processing for large profiles
- [ ] Use generators for handling large datasets
- [ ] Review object lifecycle management

### Speed Improvements
- [ ] Implement proper LRU caching for browser detection
- [ ] Optimize parallel processing implementation
- [ ] Add progress reporting for long-running operations
- [ ] Implement backup compression with configurable levels
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for key operations

## Phase 3: Feature Enhancements

### Security Improvements
- [ ] Implement end-to-end encryption for backups
- [ ] Add secure credential handling
- [ ] Implement proper permission checking for profile access
- [ ] Add integrity verification for backups

### Extensibility
- [ ] Design and implement plugin architecture
- [ ] Create plugin documentation and examples
- [ ] Make browser detection extensible for custom browsers
- [ ] Implement event system for inter-module communication

### Cloud Integration
- [ ] Design cloud storage abstraction layer
- [ ] Implement provider-specific adapters (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
- [ ] Add incremental sync capabilities
- [ ] Implement conflict resolution strategies

## Phase 4: User Experience Improvements

### GUI Enhancements
- [ ] Redesign interface for clarity and consistency
- [ ] Implement proper progress indicators for all operations
- [ ] Add detailed error messages with recovery suggestions
- [ ] Create wizard-style interface for common operations
- [ ] Add dark mode and theming support

### TUI Improvements
- [ ] Update to latest Textual API
- [ ] Implement consistent keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Add comprehensive help system
- [ ] Enhance visual feedback during operations

### CLI Refinements
- [ ] Implement structured output (JSON, YAML) for scripting
- [ ] Add batch operation support
- [ ] Improve error reporting and exit codes
- [ ] Create comprehensive man pages

## Phase 5: Compatibility & Reliability

### Browser Support
- [ ] Comprehensive testing with all major browsers
- [ ] Create automated browser detection tests
- [ ] Add support for upcoming browser versions
- [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms for unsupported browsers

### Cross-Platform Improvements
- [ ] Test thoroughly on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- [ ] Fix platform-specific bugs
- [ ] Implement platform-specific optimizations
- [ ] Create platform-specific installation packages

### Error Handling & Recovery
- [ ] Implement automatic backup before migrations
- [ ] Add recovery options for failed operations
- [ ] Create detailed logging for troubleshooting
- [ ] Implement crash reporting (opt-in)

## Implementation Timeline

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
- Code cleanup and immediate bug fixes
- Update dependencies to latest versions
- Implement basic testing framework

### Medium-term (1-2 months)
- Complete core architecture refactoring
- Implement performance optimizations
- Enhance user interfaces

### Long-term (3-6 months)
- Implement plugin system
- Add cloud integration
- Comprehensive browser support
- Cross-platform optimization

## Measurement Criteria
- 95%+ test coverage for core functionality
- No critical bugs in production
- Maximum 500ms response time for UI operations
- 50% reduction in memory usage for large migrations
- Support for all major browsers (>1% market share)
